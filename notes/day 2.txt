Outline: ================================

* Activity Lifecycle
Intents
Broadcast receiver (listen for incoming SMS, etc)
Rest service --- spring boot (Raptor JAX - RS)
Async task httpclient
JSON parsing
Access google geocode or google places API and parse the JSON data
Adapter based views.custom List adapter
	get contact info and display in custom list which has a checkbox


Activity Lifecycle ============================ (Todo: understand when activity switches, under what situation)
	must call super. method
	onSaveInstanceState() and onRestoreInstanceState() preserve activity state
	onDestroy() is only called when the activity is gracefully closed

Intent ============================
	intention
	can explicitly specify the app to complete action with, or implicitly and let user choose
	can start another App

Broadcast Receiver class ============================
	eg: get text msg content and change phone ringer mode with AudioManager
	onReceive method

Intent-filter ==============================
	 intent, String action, 

Practice
1) broadcast receiver for intentfilter action = 1
2) broadcast an intent with action value = 1

RESTful service -- spring boot

http://maps.google.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=chengdu&sensor=false (chengdu is the address)

Google geocode =========================
	make geocode request, get JSON request, parse JSON and get the result
